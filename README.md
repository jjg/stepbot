#Stepbot#
A simple, printable, "turtle-style" robot platform designed to be inexpensive and easy to make.

This project is a work-in-progress, all designs, circuits, software and parts are far from release-ready.

##Materials##

 * 3D printed parts
 * 2 28BYJ-48 stepper motors & controller boards (I got 5 off ebay for about $10)
 * 1 Arduino-compatible microcontroller (I'm using this breakout board: https://www.tindie.com/products/mwhelectronics/atmega328p-breakout-board/)
 * 1 12v battery (currently using 8AA batteries but considering something lighter)
 * 1 12v to 5v voltage converter (I'm using the guts of a cheap USB car charger)
 * 2 tyres (those "awareness" wristbands are probably the easiest thing to find)
